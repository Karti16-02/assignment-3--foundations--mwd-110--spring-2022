## ❖・Introduction・❖
This assignment is designed to initiate you into the world of creating web pages using advanced concepts in CSS, employing what you’ve learned thus far and adding your own design sense.

Create a one-page website for the musical album of your choice featured in one of the pre-defined text files in the `content` folder. Populate `index.html` with the content for the musical album you’ve chosen, then proceed to create the website. (**Note**: *You may __not__ modify the content in any of the `.txt` files.*) There’s no restriction on what you may do design-wise.

## ❖・Rules・❖
* Only submit files that are required by your project: **Do not** submit working files, such as `.psd`, `.ai`, `.indd`, or `.sketch` files.
* Use lowercase, combined with kebab case, to name folders and files (`do-this` or `do-this.html`); no spaces in folder or file names (`not this`); no camel case (`notThis`); no snake case (`not_this`).
* Place all your markup in `index.html`.
* Do not alter or remove the inclusion of `reset.css` in the `head` of `index.html`.
* Place your CSS in `style.css`. You may use include more CSS files, should you need to.
* Do not alter or remove any of the `.gitignore` files.
* The only files you may add are images, which, if included, must go in the `img` folder.
* Images _**must be 1MB or smaller**_. **Images above 1MB incur a 30-pt penalty, at the very least. If images are too big, then the entire pull request will be rejected and this project will be treated as though an assignment was never submitted.**
