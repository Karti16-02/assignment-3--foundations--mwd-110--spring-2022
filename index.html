    <p>Like previously said, Project Karti is an upcoming clothing business. Over the course of 2021 till now, I have been making designs that I feel are best to be considered designs. Over the past year, I have over 70 designs now. As each design is made I start to figure out how these designs will be displayed on t-shirts/hoodies. Along with that I have been trying to figure out when it would be best to drop certain designs. These are not just average designs. </p>
    <p>When I say these designs are not just average I really mean that. When I create designs I don't just take images of the internet and stick a bunch of words on it. If I did that then it would be me creating a business that's less than average. My goal is to make sure that Project Karti is known for its high quality design. Which leaves my consumers with questions. When will Project Karti drop and what will these designs look like on the product❓</p>
